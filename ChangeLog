Version 1.5[October 3, 2010]
					- Changed to dynamic memory allocation
					for everything so there are no more
					limits on the sizes of profiles or
					song titles.
					- Properly converting international
					characters so they don't just show up
					as a question mark. (Thanks to George
					S for the tip)

Version 1.4[September 24, 2008]
					- Fixed bug where Pidgin would crash if it got disconnected

Version 1.3[May 29, 2008]
					- Bug fix: plugin will now work when different messages are set
						for different protocols. (Thanks to Sachin for the tip)

Version 1.2[May 5, 2008]
					- Using IPC to get whether or not Winamp is playing. This message works fine and should cause the plugin
						to run a little faster.

Version 1.1[April 24, 2008]
					- Apparently there are some issues with using IPC. It doesn't work if the song doesn't have an ID3 tag, it doesn't work
						with the foobar plugins and if you look in the wa_ipc.h file it says the messages we're using aren't even supposed
						to be used to external programs.
					- So, I switched back to the old way to get the song information with a few small improvements.

Version 1.0[March 31, 2008]
					- Using IPC to get Winamp info. Much more reliable and don't have parse the title string anymore
						(Thanks to Leonardo Fernandes for the IPC code)
					- Some code cleanup for my string functions
					- Using some #defines now instead of variables
					- Just using one GList now to store info for each account. Much more efficient
					- Now catches the "status-changed" signal to update right away when the user changes his status info
					- All status types should now work
					- Changed how some things are stored in order to save memory

Version 0.7[May 8, 2007]
					- Tried to fix international character issue but still not sure if it's working
					- Converted everything over to work for Pidgin/Purple
					- Removed the broken foobar support, use a winamp emulation plugin for
						foobar from now on
					- Changed to new website in the info

Version 0.6[October 19, 2006]
					- Added privacy option for users to hide what they're listening to with an option
						on the Tools menu
					-Compiled for Gaim2.0.0beta4

Version 0.5[March 31, 2006]
					- Added support for multiple accounts
					- Mostly fixed bug where errors would occur if a non-ASCII character was in a song title
						Still seems to occur sporadically, though. Will keep working on it
					- Fixed for foobar2000 v0.9 (must use 0.9 now)

Version 0.4.1[March 3, 2006]
					- Fixed bug where if the user changed from away to available and vice-versa
						while keeping the message the same it wouldn't update until the song changed.
					- Updated summary and description

Version 0.4[March 1, 2006]
					- Made hiding text more efficient
					- Available and Away Messages now work the same way as User Info, just put in the tags and
						they will be replaced.
					- Updates every 15 seconds
					- Separator for parsing the winamp window is now " - " instead of just '-' to fix problems
						with hyphenated song names (thanks to Kyle H. for the tip)
					- Now works with foobar2000 (thanks to Matthew C. for the tip)

Version 0.3.2[November 14, 2005]
					- Fixed bug where plugin wouldn't update right after signing off and signing back on
					- Added more code comments

Version 0.3.1[November 9, 2005]
					- Stopped it from sending an update to the server every 30 seconds even when one wasn't needed

Version 0.3[November 9, 2005]
					- Added a lot of extra customization:
						Now %so% gets replaced with the song, %ar% with the artist.
						(mi),(/mi),(ns), and (/ns) can be used to mark text for hiding/showing
						depending on whether you're listening to music or not
					- minor bug fixes

Version 0.2[October 17, 2005]
					- Checks to make sure that there is any user info before updating it.
						This will speed things up a bit and fix a nasty bug that occurred 
						when the protocol didn't support user info.
					- Will only attempt to run on the first account that signs on.
						Multiple accounts will be supported eventually, but for now this
						is needed to prevent multiple calls to my non-thread-safe functions
						and to stop it from getting really confused and screwing stuff up
						if the profiles are updated at different times.
					- Used more length checking to prevent buffer overflows
					- Made string sizes smarter
					- A little bit of code cleanup

Version 0.1[October 6, 2005]
					- First release
